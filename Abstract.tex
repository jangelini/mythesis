Due to the increase of the older adults population with dementia, the quantity of caregivers has increased. Anxiety is one of the top problems that affect to caregivers. Current studies are based in traditional techinques like polls or questionaries and only show results in long term. Wearable computing (computers small enough to be used as clothes) have the capacity to sense the user at all time. This opens the opportunity to detect anxiety spans at the moment. Despite the fact that anxiety problems are worse in long term, caregivers may be benefited by the state anxiety detection. In this work, an experiment design to gather caregivers of dementia anxiety data  in naturalistic situations and a technique to detect anxiety is reported.
